- 👋 Hi, I’m @PumpkinSkink2
- 👀 I’m interested in chemistry, physical science in general, video games, politics, and math.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, tensorflow, LUA.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything I can help with. I'm just trying to improve my coding in a pretty general way. I am especially interested in video games playing themselves, finding ways to automate analytical chemistry analysis, fact-checking information, and using machine learning to over complicate projects. 
- 📫 You can reach me at PumpkinSkink2@gmail.com if you want to chat.
